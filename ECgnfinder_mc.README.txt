ECgnfinder_mc.py is a program which use 1000 E. coli gene to build a 1st order markov chain and apply markov chain to test another 500 E. coli gene to do the prediction.

There are three files in the folder which can be used for running the program. They are ECgnfinder_mc.py, 500_gene.fasta and gene_1000.fasta.

Input: python ECgnfinder_mc.py -i [INPUT_FILE]

Output: There are two output files. One is the prediction of possible genes which are in "output_gene.fasta" file and the other is predicted protein sequences after translating from the predicted genes which are in "output_protein.fasta" file. 

Sample usage: python ECgnfinder_mc.py -i 500_gene.fasta
